        <h1 class="second-heading" >Why He Is The GOAT</h1>

        <img width="500" height="300" src="images/images.jpg">


        <p style="text-indent:50px;">Demetrious Johnson is often called the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) in MMA because of a unique combination of skill, dominance, and evolution as a fighter:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unmatched Skill Set:</strong> He’s one of the most complete fighters ever—elite in striking, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, clinch work, and transitions. He blends techniques smoothly in a way few others can.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Fight IQ:</strong> Johnson is incredibly intelligent in the cage. He adapts mid-fight, exploits opponents’ weaknesses, and makes almost no mistakes. His creativity—like hitting a flying armbar in the middle of a title fight—shows a level of mastery few achieve.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Consistency and Dominance:</strong> He defended his UFC flyweight title 11 times, the most in that division and one of the longest streaks in UFC history. Most of his wins weren’t close—he completely controlled elite opponents.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Pound-for-Pound Greatness:</strong> Despite being in a lighter weight class, where speed and technique matter more than raw power, Johnson often looked untouchable. Many experts rank him at the top regardless of weight class.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Humility and Professionalism:</strong> He stayed humble, respectful, and drama-free while quietly building one of the greatest careers in combat sports.</li>
        </ol>
       
        <p style="text-indent:50px;"> Demetrious Johnson is the GOAT because he mastered every part of MMA, dominated for years, and carried himself like a true martial artist the entire time.</p>
